# Lottie Animator - SVG to Motion Graphics

Professional skill to create advanced Lottie animations from SVGs, eliminating the After Effects workflow entirely by using intelligent motion design.

---

## Quick Reference: 8-Step Animation Checklist

Before creating or writing any animation keyframes, you **MUST** align on the following checklist:

1. **Emotional target?** — What should the viewer feel? (joy, calm, trust, excitement, urgency)
2. **Motion Personality?** — Select exactly one archetype: Playful, Premium, Corporate, or Energetic.
3. **Primary property?** — Focus on the hero transition first: position (`p`), scale (`s`), rotation (`r`), or opacity (`o`).
4. **Distance and Timing?** — Calculate target frames based on the 1/3 spatial scaling rule.
5. **Easing family?** — Map curve constants: entrance = ease-out, exit = ease-in, loop = ease-in-out.
6. **Hero elements?** — Plan staging offsets (hero enters 100-200ms after background).
7. **Secondary & ambient layers?** — Plan secondary accents (shadow shifts, spark wiggles).
8. **Volume Preservation?** — Keep X/Y scale multiplication constant (`~10,000`) for wiggles and squashes (skip for premium).

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when the user requests:
- Animate a logo, icon, or SVG graphic
- Create motion graphics or vector animations
- Generate Lottie JSON files
- Effects: wiggle, bounce, rotate, pulse, fade, scale, morph
- Entrance, loop, loading animations, or transitions
- Path drawing/reveal animations (Trim Path)
- Character animation, walking cycles, run cycles
- Shape morphing (icon transitions)
- Replace After Effects workflow

**Decision tree:**
1. Does it serve a functional purpose (feedback, guidance)? → Apply strict responsive timing rules (<150ms).
2. Does it express brand personality? → Select and stick to a single Motion Personality archetype.
3. Does it tell a story or guide attention? → Apply adapted Disney principles (anticipation, arcs, staging).
4. Is this a complex multi-element scene? → Plan layers, parenting bone systems, and stagger offsets.

## Critical: SVG Understanding

Before animating ANY SVG, you MUST understand its path structure.

See: [references/svg-to-lottie.md](references/svg-to-lottie.md)

### SVG Path Command Quick Reference

| Command | Description | Lottie Conversion |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| M x,y | Move to | Starting vertex |
| L x,y | Line to | Vertex with zero tangents |
| C cp1 cp2 end | Cubic bezier | Native support |
| Q ctrl end | Quadratic bezier | Convert to cubic |
| A rx ry ... | Arc | Split into cubic segments |
| Z | Close path | Set `c: true` |

### Path to Lottie Vertex Formula

```
For C x1,y1 x2,y2 x,y from point (px, py):
- Previous vertex outTangent: [x1-px, y1-py]
- Current vertex: [x, y]
- Current vertex inTangent: [x2-x, y2-y]
```

---

## Main Workflow

### Phase 1: Motion Philosophy (30 seconds)

**MANDATORY** before any code. Define:

1. **Brand Personality**: Professional, playful, elegant, energetic (see [references/motion-personality.md](references/motion-personality.md))
2. **Emotional Response**: Trust, excitement, calm, urgency
3. **Motion Metaphor**: Fluid like water, solid like rock, light like air

```
Example: "Fintech Logo → professional + trust → precise and controlled movement"
Example: "Music App → creative + energy → organic with rhythmic pulses"
Example: "Healthcare → calm + reliable → smooth, slow easings"
```

### Phase 2: SVG Deep Analysis

Before animating, thoroughly analyze:
1. **Structure**: Elements, groups, paths, viewBox dimensions
2. **Path Complexity**: Vertex count, curve types (C, Q, A commands)
3. **Hierarchy**: Primary elements vs. secondary details
4. **Animation Opportunities**: Independent parts, stroke-based vs fill-based

```bash
# Analyze SVG structure
cat icon.svg | grep -E '<(path|g|rect|circle|ellipse|line|polyline)' | head -30
```

**Key Questions**:
- Is it stroke-based? → Consider Trim Path animation.
- Multiple paths? → Consider staggered entrance.
- Complex shape? → Consider scale/rotate instead of morph.
- Icon library (Phosphor/Lucide)? → Clean, minimal vertices.

### Phase 3: Animation Strategy Selection

| Strategy | Best For | Technique | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Draw On** | Stroke icons, signatures | Trim Path | [#shape-modifiers](#shape-modifiers) |
| **Pop In** | Logos, buttons | Scale + Opacity | [references/disney-principles.md](references/disney-principles.md) |
| **Morph** | Icon transitions (hamburger→X) | Path keyframes | [references/professional-techniques.md](references/professional-techniques.md) |
| **Stagger** | Multiple elements | Delayed start times | [references/disney-principles.md](references/disney-principles.md) |
| **Character** | People, mascots | Parenting + bone hierarchy | [references/professional-techniques.md](references/professional-techniques.md) |
| **Loader** | Progress, spinners | Rotation + Trim Path | [#shape-modifiers](#shape-modifiers) |
| **Frame-by-Frame** | Walk/run cycles, complex characters | `ip`/`op` layer switching | [references/professional-techniques.md](references/professional-techniques.md) |

---

### Phase 4: Create Lottie JSON

See: [references/lottie-structure.md](references/lottie-structure.md)

**Base Structure:**
```json
{
  "v": "5.12.1",
  "fr": 60,
  "ip": 0,
  "op": 120,
  "w": 512,
  "h": 512,
  "nm": "Animation Name",
  "ddd": 0,
  "assets": [],
  "layers": []
}
```

---

### Phase 5: Apply Professional Easing and Timing

Map bezier curves and frame durations strictly using your selected archetype.

See: [references/bezier-easing.md](references/bezier-easing.md)

| Use Case | Out Tangent (`o`) | In Tangent (`i`) | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|------------|---|
| **Entrance (Ease Out)** | `[0.33, 0]` | `[0.67, 1]` | Fast start, gentle settle |
| **Exit (Ease In)** | `[0.55, 0.055]` | `[0.675, 0.19]` | Gentle start, explosive departure |
| **Loop (Ease In Out)** | `[0.645, 0.045]` | `[0.355, 1]` | Seamless symmetrical timing |
| **Bounce (Playful)** | `[0.34, 1.56]` | `[0.64, 1]` | Bouncy overshoot, soft settle |
| **Spring (Elastic)** | `[0.5, 1.5]` | `[0.5, 0.9]` | High responsiveness, dynamic tension |

---

### Phase 6: Validate and Export

```bash
# Validate JSON structure
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('animation.json'))"

# Preview
echo "Open in: https://lottiefiles.com/preview"
```
